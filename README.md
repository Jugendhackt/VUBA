## What is VUBA?
VUBA is a webapp to find the nearest bike from all bike sharing apps.
## Why?
Sometimes you need to find the nearest bike.
Without VUBA you had to look through every bike sharing app to find the nearest.
With VUBA you just open VUBA, find the nearest bike and afterwards open the corresponding bike app.

This token will saved on your machine and not on a server.<br>
